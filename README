Save for Web plug-in for The GIMP
=====================

Save for Web plug-ins allows to experiment with various popular web format
options. It shows an automatically updated preview and file size statistics.

To build and install it, just ...

	./configure
	make
	make install

 ... and it's there.

If building from a GIT clone, you'll need to run ./autogen.sh first (see the HACKING file)
