Save for Web plug-in for The GIMP
=================================

Save for Web plug-ins allows to experiment with various popular web format
options. It shows an automatically updated preview and file size statistics.

Pre-requisites
==============
To compile in Debian/Ubuntu, first install the following:
$ sudo apt-get install libtool automake intltool libgimp2.0-dev

Building
========
To build and install it, just ...

	./configure
	make
	make install

 ... and it's there.
 
If you want to install the plug-in for local user only, instead of make install do:
$ cp src/webexport ~/.gimp-X.X/plug-ins/
(replace X.X with the version of GIMP installed)

If building from a GIT clone, you'll need to run ./autogen.sh first (see the HACKING file)
